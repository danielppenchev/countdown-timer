# countdown-timer
-- A simple page that enables the user to fill in their name, the date until which they want the countdown to be initialised, and their current time zone. 
-- All input fields go through validating if the data provided is correct and if yes, the body switches to a countdown timer from today to the specified data with timezone added or subtracted to the time. 
-- A back button has been added for convenience so that the user doesn't have to refresh the page each time.
